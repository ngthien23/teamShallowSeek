### Climate Issues vs. Policy Implementation (RAG-Optimized Format)

#### Climate Finance & New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG)
- **Issue:** Developing nations demand at least $1.3 - $2 trillion per year in climate finance. Developed nations resist setting a fixed amount and favor private sector investment over public grants.
- **Policy Reality:** Implemented policies mainly focus on national emission targets (e.g., NDCs) rather than securing new climate finance mechanisms.

#### Loss and Damage (L&D) Finance
- **Issue:** Developing countries insist on including L&D finance in the NCQG; developed nations want it separate.
- **Policy Reality:** Existing policies focus on emission reduction and adaptation strategies, but few specifically allocate funds for climate-induced damages.

#### Just Transition & Equity
- **Issue:** There is no clear consensus on just transition policies; workers and vulnerable communities need protection.
- **Policy Reality:** Some national energy policies mention transition plans, but implementation remains unclear, and funding is inadequate.

#### Fossil Fuel Phase-Out vs. Expansion
- **Issue:** Despite global commitments, countries still subsidize fossil fuels, and companies continue investing in expansion (e.g., Petrobras' $111B fossil fuel investment).
- **Policy Reality:** Energy policies promote renewable energy but often coexist with fossil fuel expansion plans.

#### Adaptation Finance Crisis
- **Issue:** The Adaptation Fund remains significantly underfunded, far below the required targets.
- **Policy Reality:** Most policies focus on mitigation strategies rather than securing concrete financial support for adaptation.

#### Carbon Markets & Article 6.4
- **Issue:** Carbon offset markets lack transparency, and many carbon credits fail to deliver real emission reductions.
- **Policy Reality:** Policies reference carbon trading mechanisms but do not establish strong regulatory oversight or accountability measures.

#### Expanding the Contributor Base
- **Issue:** Developed nations push for emerging economies to contribute more to climate finance.
- **Policy Reality:** Implemented policies focus on national-level commitments but do not address financial burden-sharing between developed and developing countries.

#### Procedural Delays & Political Disagreements
- **Issue:** COP29 negotiations face delays due to political disputes, including disagreements over finance commitments.
- **Policy Reality:** National policies exist, but progress is slow due to the lack of international cooperation and political will.

#### Climate Justice & Human Rights
- **Issue:** Indigenous and marginalized communities struggle for climate justice and policy inclusion.
- **Policy Reality:** Few policies explicitly address social equity, Indigenous rights, or gender-sensitive climate policies.

#### Mitigation Ambition vs. Slow Implementation
- **Issue:** Countries argue that finance must come before stronger mitigation targets, delaying progress.
- **Policy Reality:** While policies establish long-term mitigation goals, enforcement mechanisms remain weak.

### Summary for RAG:
While **climate discussions at COP29** focus on large-scale financing, just transitions, and fossil fuel phase-outs, **actual policy implementation lags behind**. National policies primarily **address emission reduction targets** but **fail to secure financing, ensure just transitions, or enforce climate justice**.
